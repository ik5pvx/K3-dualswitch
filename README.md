# K3-dualswitch
Control a DXE-RR2X8B with a K3.

The DX-Engineering DXE-RR2X8B is a 2-radios, 8-antennas remote switch,
controlled with 2 separate 1-of-8 lines. It features built in
protection to avoid selecting the same antenna from the 2 radios. When
this happens, the "Master" radio is connected to the requested
antenna, while the "Slave" will get an open line. 

The Elecraft K3 transceiver can, depending on installed options, have
2 antennas connected to separate receivers, or it can provide choice
of antenna to one receiver. 

The purpose of this interface is to allow tracking the transmit
antenna automatically from the K3 band lines on the accessory port,
while allowing automatic or manual selection of a secondary antenna
for the second antenna input. 

The schematic and the software are released to PUBLIC DOMAIN.
